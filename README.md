# SKY-CLAW
Fully Open Source Gantry-Style Robotic Gripper
The claw is a four degree of freedom robot equipped with multiple sensors and actuators. The four degrees of freedom are horizontal translation, vertical translation, (passive) rotation, and grasping motion. The claw is similar to a gantry crane that might be found at a construction site or in a warehouse. The purpose of this project is to provide an educational platform for teaching mechatronics. The benefits of this platform are:
  a) It provides a diverse set of sensors and actuators:
       i) Sensors: limit switches, proximity sensor, linear potentiometer, rotary encoders.
       ii) Actuators: Stepper motor, brushed DC motor, servo
  b) It is 100% open source and uses common commercial off-the-shelf components and complete solid models of all parts including drawings of custom-made parts.
  c) All custom-made components are easy to manufacture. If a student breaks it, he or she can also repair it.
